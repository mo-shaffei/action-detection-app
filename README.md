# Action Detection in Smart Surveillance Systems - Web Application

In this project, AI-based smart surveillance system capable of automatically detecting different actions was implemented on the Zewail City video surveillance system.
The system reached a recall of 80% and a precision of 70% without fine-tuning using custom data. The system provided different features for the end-user through its graphical interface allowing for easy and convenient data retrieval.


## Features

**Logs page:**


1- The user can view the history of actions along with some metadata:

    - The *id* of the *camera* that captured that action.
    - The *timestamp* indicating the start and end of the action.
    - The *Building* and *location* where the action happened.
    - The *confidence* of the predicted action.

2- The user can filter by:

    - Actions
    - Building
    - Location 
    - Camera 
    - Start, end date and time.

**Visualizations page:**

It provides different visualizations that deliver key insights to the user.

## How to run the code


## Run Locally

1- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mo-shaffei/action-detection-app
```

2- Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd action-detection-app
```

3- Install dependencies


- if you have CUDA

```bash
    pip install moviepy
    conda install -c pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2
    conda install -c conda-forge -c fvcore -c iopath fvcore=0.1.4 iopath
    pip install pytorchvideo
    conda install -c anaconda flask
    conda install -c anaconda pymongo
    conda install -c anaconda pandas
    python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
    pip install scikit-video
    pip install opencv-python
```
    
- if you don't have CUDA

```bash
    pip install moviepy
    conda install -c pytorch torchvision cpuonly
    conda install -c conda-forge -c fvcore -c iopath fvcore=0.1.4 iopath
    pip install pytorchvideo
    conda install -c anaconda flask
    conda install -c anaconda pymongo
    conda install -c anaconda pandas
    python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
    pip install scikit-video
    pip install opencv-python
```

4- Start the server

```bash
    flask run
```
